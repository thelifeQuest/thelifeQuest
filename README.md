Hi, I'm Ali. 
I create fun easy puzzles for me and my friends to enjoy. 
I mainly code in my free time since it's just a hobby for me. 
I also like learning about Networking and Pentesting using platforms like THM and HTB. 
You're welcome to try out my "Puzzles", but if you're on Github, the puzzles would be anything but a challenge.
